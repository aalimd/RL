DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR HOSTINGER (v4 - Automation Ready)
======================================================
Updated: Jan 29, 2026

1. PREPARATION
   - Ensure your hosting runs PHP 8.2 or higher.
   - Database: MySQL or MariaDB.

2. UPLOAD
   - Zip the entire project folder (exclude node_modules, tests, .git).
   - Upload to your `public_html` (or subfolder).
   - Extract the files.

3. WEB INSTALLATION (Recommended)
   - Go to: `https://your-domain.com/install`
   - Follow the wizard.
   - It will set up the database structure automatically (including the new QR Code and Verification features).

4. MANUAL INSTALLATION (If wizard fails)
   - Create a database in Hostinger.
   - Import the file: `/install/database/fresh_install.sql` via phpMyAdmin.
   - Rename `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`.
   - Edit `.env` and fill in DB credentials and URL.
   - Run `php artisan key:generate` (via SSH) or manually set APP_KEY if you can't access SSH.

5. IMPORTANT PERMISSIONS (Fix 500 Errors)
   - Go to File Manager.
   - Right-click `backend/storage` -> Permissions.
   - Set to **775** (or 777 not recommended but works if 775 fails).
   - Ensure `backend/bootstrap/cache` is also **775**.

6. SYMLINK (For Images)
   - If you have SSH access: `cd backend && php artisan storage:link`
   - If no SSH, you can try creating a PHP file named `link.php` in `public` folder with:
     <?php symlink(__DIR__.'/../backend/storage/app/public', __DIR__.'/storage'); echo 'Done'; ?>
     Then visit `your-domain.com/link.php` once.

7. AUTOMATION & QUEUES
   - The system is designed to work without complex queue workers for basic emails.
   - If emails are slow, configure a Cron Job for `php artisan schedule:run`.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- "500 Internal Server Error": Almost always folder permissions (Step 5).
- "Class not found": Run `composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev` if you have SSH.
